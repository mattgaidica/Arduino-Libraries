![Real Time Clock Module](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/r/500-500/assets/parts/1/2/6/9/1/14558-SparkFun_Real_Time_Clock_Module_-_RV-1805__Qwiic_-01.jpg)

[*Qwiic RV-1805 RTC Module (BOB-14558)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14558)

The RV-1805 is an extremely precise, extremely low power, highly configurable RTC. Under ideal conditions it runs at approximately 22nA with +/-6ppm per year of deviation (+/- 192 seconds worst case per year).

This library allows the user to:

* Set time using hard numbers or the BUILD_TIME from the Arduino compiler
* Read time
* Configure various aspects of the RTC including setting of alarms, interrupts, and wave outputs

Examples are included to get you started

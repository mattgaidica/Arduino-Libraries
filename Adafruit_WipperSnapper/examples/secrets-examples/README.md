## secrets.json Examples

This folder contains templates for the `secrets.json` configuration file used by WipperSnapper's filesystem-backed-provisioning. This provisioning is only available to hardware compatible with TinyUSB.

Each `.json` file contains Adafruit IO credentials and a single `network_type` object used to define a network interface's type and specific properties.

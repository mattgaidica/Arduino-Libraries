# AudioZero

The Audio library enables an Arduino an Arduino based on SAMD architectures (all MKR boards, Nano 33 IoT and more) to play back **.wav** files from a storage device like an SD card.

The Zero and the MKR1000 use the DAC0 pin to play sounds.

To use this library

```
#include <AudioZero.h>
```

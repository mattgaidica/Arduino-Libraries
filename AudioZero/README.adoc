The {repository-name} library enables an Arduino SAMD Board (e.g., https://store.arduino.cc/catalogsearch/result/?q=mkr[MKR boards], https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-nano-33-iot[Nano 33 IoT], https://store.arduino.cc/arduino-zero[Zero]) to play back .wav files from a storage device like an SD card to the `DAC0`/`A0` pin.
